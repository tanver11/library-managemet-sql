# library-managemet-sql
We create a automated library management system where he user will find this automated system easy instead of using the manual writing system.

The concept behind this project is to create a library management system that is capable to issue books and let consumers check different books and their 
titles categorically. It keeps track of all the details about the books in the library, their price, status, and the total number of books available in the Library.
The user will find this automated system easy instead of using the manual writing system.
